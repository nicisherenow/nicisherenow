### A brief introduction
I am a full-stack software engineer with a passion for teamwork. I have extensive experience in developing web applications using technologies such as JavaScript, React, Redux, SQL, and Python. My love for coding and desire to create user-friendly and innovative software solutions has driven my career thus far. I am always striving to expand my skill set and increase my skill competency.

In my free time, I am dedicated to maintaining an active lifestyle through my love for fitness. I believe that physical health is just as important as mental health, and I enjoy challenging myself with new workouts and pushing myself to new limits.

I am confident in my ability to work well under pressure, deliver high-quality work, and work collaboratively with a team to achieve common goals. I am also capable in working solo with minimal guidance towards a specific goal. I am eager to continue to grow as a software engineer and be a valuable member of any team that I work with.
